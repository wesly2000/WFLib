WFlib is a Pytorch-based open-source library for website fingerprinting attacks, intended for research purposes only.

Website fingerprinting is a type of network attack in which an adversary attempts to deduce which website a user is visiting based on encrypted traffic patterns, even without directly seeing the content of the traffic.

We provide a neat code base to evaluate 11 advanced DL-based WF attacks on multiple datasets. This library is derived from our ACM CCS 2024 paper. If you find this repo useful, please cite our paper.

- The extracted dataset is in npz format and contains two values: X and y. X represents the cell sequence, with values being the direction (e.g., 1 or -1) multiplied by the timestamp. y corresponds to the labels. Note that the input of some datasets consists only of direction sequences.

- Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

```sh
# For single-tab datasets
python exp/dataset_process/dataset_split.py --dataset CW
# For multi-tab datasets
python exp/dataset_process/dataset_split.py --dataset Closed_2tab --use_stratify False
```

### Training \& Evaluation

We provide all experiment scripts for WF attacks in the folder `./scripts/`. For example, you can reproduce the DF attack on the CW dataset by executing the following command.

```sh
bash scripts/DF.sh
```

The `./scripts/DF.sh` file contains the commands for model training and evaluation.

```sh
dataset=CW

python -u exp/train.py \
  --dataset ${dataset} \
  --model DF \
  --device cuda:1 \
  --feature DIR \
  --seq_len 5000 \
  --train_epochs 30 \
  --batch_size 128 \
  --learning_rate 2e-3 \
  --optimizer Adamax \
  --eval_metrics Accuracy Precision Recall F1-score \
  --save_metric F1-score \
  --save_name max_f1

python -u exp/test.py \
  --dataset ${dataset} \
  --model DF \
  --device cuda:1 \
  --feature DIR \
  --seq_len 5000 \
  --batch_size 256 \
  --eval_metrics Accuracy Precision Recall F1-score \
  --load_name max_f1
```

The meanings of all parameters can be found in the `exp/train.py` and `exp/test.py` files. WFlib supports modifying parameters to easily implement different attacks. Moreover, you can use WFlib to implement combinations of different attacks or perform ablation analysis.

## The Extended Parts
Currently, we keep the original docs unchanged, and add the docs for the extended parts in this section. The extended parts mainly includes **Visualization** and **Data Collection**.

### Data Collection
This part aims to automate the traffic collection with headless browser + Selenium, and collect traffic *asynchronously* with Scapy. Since most operations of Scapy involves OS sockets, usually it requires *sudo* to run the extended functions.

To avoid messing up your Python environment, we *highly recommend* the use of *virtual Python environment*. To be specific, a quick workaround to the *permission issue* could be solved by

```sh
$ python -m venv path/to/your/venv
$ source path/to/your/venv/bin/activate
$ pip install .
$ sudo path/to/your/venv/bin/python /your/script.py # Solve permission issue by authorizing virtual Python binary
```
